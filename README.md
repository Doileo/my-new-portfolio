# Doina Leovchin – Front-End Developer Portfolio

Welcome! This is the codebase for my **personal developer portfolio**, built with accessibility, responsiveness, and creativity in mind. It's more than a portfolio — it's a reflection of who I am as a developer and as a human.

My aim was to craft a space that shows not only the _projects_ I've worked on but also how I approach _problem-solving_, _communication_, and _user-centered design_.

## 💖 Why I Built This

I come from a background rooted in social work and small business — both centered on serving people with empathy and excellence. This portfolio blends that spirit with my technical skillset.

My goal was to create something warm, inviting, and thoughtfully engineered. Every component here reflects what I value: clear communication, inclusive design, and well-crafted code.

This is not just a technical showcase — it’s a statement of who I am and how I aim to contribute to a development team.
