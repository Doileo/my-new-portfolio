# Doina Leovchin – Front-End Developer Portfolio

Welcome! This is the codebase for my **personal developer portfolio**, built with accessibility, responsiveness, and creativity in mind. It's more than a portfolio — it's a reflection of who I am as a developer and human.

My aim was to craft a space that shows not only the _projects_ I've worked on but also how I approach _problem-solving_, _communication_, and _user-centered design_.
